### A handy application used to keep track of train schedules.
#### Guide
- Visit https://arinarooji.github.io/train-time/
- All train schedules in the database can be viewed in the **Current Train Schedule** section.
- To create another train schedule, navigate to the **Add Train** section.
- Enter the train schedule details, including the **train name**, **destination**, **frequency**, and the **first train time** *(start time)*.
- Nice job! you've added a train schedule to the database (firebase), which will periodically update on the DOM to reflect the current times.

#### Future Plans
- Delete train schedules
- Further code optimization
- Expand time calculation (time zones)
- User accounts (manage custom schedules)
- Spin off into a new time management application
